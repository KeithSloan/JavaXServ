Test new sockets and process structure
SetupServerX is not correct needs changing
Byte order X11 Client socket
Byte order java socket
Clear socket some option/flag
Update new sockets and process structure for inetd
Create XRequest & Xsocket class
Improve Tracing
Test xcalc
Test xterm
Need to understand difference VisualID, ColorMap
Connection Setup : Byteorder of images, ColorMaps, VisualID etc

Change Window and Pixmap handling so that just send to Java Client and Client to deal with.

General Sort out use of puts and writes

GetInputFocus Just return None for now.
removePixMap just reports

Colour

Java does not seem to have any concept of reality about colour. For example that displays may only support
a minimum number of colours. It does not have the facilities like X11 for managing Colour maps and
allocating colours. As java supports sRGB colour one can only assume that it assumes the browser
has the ability to display all colours as sRGB regardless of display monitor.

Therefore all colour map handling will be done on the server and facilities
added to ship colour maps to the java client where they will be implemented as Index colour model.
The default colourmap will be that of the server X11 system, maybe a future enhancement would be
to set the initial colour map from the client based on browser(?)

AllocColor
Add code to notify java client of change in colour map.

ColorMap
Add code to setup initial colour map

Fonts
  Error handling on direct X requests i.e. ::XFreeFontInfo(namePtr,fontPtr,num);
  fontPointSize is not at all correct maybe an XFont call to determine size
