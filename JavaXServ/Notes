Colour

Java does not seem to have any concept of reality about colour. For example that displays may only support
a minimum number of colours. It does not have the facilities like X11 for managing Colour maps and
allocating colours. As java supports sRGB colour one can only assume that it assumes the browser
has the ability to display all colours as sRGB regardless of display monitor.

Therefore all colour map handling will be done on the server and facilities
added to ship colour maps to the java client where they will be implemented as Index colour model.
The default colourmap will be that of the server X11 system, maybe a future enhancement would be
to set the initial colour map from the client based on browser(?)
