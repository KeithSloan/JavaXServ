See also Client ToDo in www/XServ directory.

Base README
Add jnlp & jar of Java Client ( add to Makefile )
Xwindows app to do a login and then xctl to client passed in command line.
Java Client uses unchecked Arrays
    1) Make Array size a parameter passed from HTML
    2) Bound check and expand Array
    3) Make linked list - but performance ?

Further develop test clients    
    Map/UnMap
    PixMap
    Add to BasicDraw other draw operations - Roll out Graphics Context colour as per DrawRectangle
    Line thickness and styles

Server Makefile generic
some X11 window attributes handling need implementing as using X11 calls will not allow concurrence with different threads.
Further work on Fonts
Improve C++ class javaSock extend socket
Improve Java Class - Linked Lists
X_ClipRectangle - uses GC not sure how to implement
X_ReparentWindow

Known issues with test clients
==============================
xclock 	  - seems to need XOR on draw, not sure how this is set or default
xcalc	  - Map & Unmap of Windows
     	    Text Math's font for Pi and superscript
xcolor 	  - Issue with X_ReparentWindow
BasicDraw - Need to action Graphics Context 24 bit colour.
            Rectangle does not look in the right place
