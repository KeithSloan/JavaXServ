JavaXServ website readme.

This directory needs to be accessed by the HTML server typically Apache2.

For a typical apache2 configuration then symbolically link from /var/www to this directory.
Or if not exclusive to JavaXserv then a subdirectory off of /var/www

html files must be configured to point to the place where JavaXServ is running
<applet code=server.class width=200 height=50>
<param name=server value="127.0.0.1">
<param name=port value=6789>
<param name=application value="xclock">
</applet>

i.e. server value is host where JavaXServ is running
port value is the port on which JavaXserv is listening
application value is the name of the XClient that JavaXServ should fork
