Install instructions for Raspbian
=================================

   sudo apt-get install libx11-dev libxpm-dev xvfb

   git clone git://git.code.sf.net/p/javaxserv/code javaxserv-code

   cd javaserv-code
   make

To Setup Demo 
=============

Webserver needs to be a static addresss as does machine where JavaXServ will run

Install X11 apps
    sudo apt-get install x11-apps

symbolically Link to Apache directory
    ln -s ~/javaxserv-code/www /var/www/DemoJavaXServ
    cd ..


For the supplied html files to work two entries need to be added to /etc/hosts
for hostnames WebServer and JavaXServ

For example if the static address is 192.168.1.2

Then add
192.168.1.2    WebServer
192.168.1.2    JavaXServ

WebServer is where the Java code will be served from i.e. the Webserver
JavaXServ should be the machine where the JavaXServ process is being run.

/etc/hosts seems to allow duplicate IP addresses, but different names.


To run JavaXServ
=================
    From directory javaserv-code/JavaXServ

    cd JavaXServ
    Xvfb :2 &
    export DISPLAY=:2.0
    ./javaXServ

From a Java Enabled Browser Access the DemoJavaServ directory
=============================================================
     
    JavaXServ is an unsigned app.

    My understanding is that you have to pay money to get a certificate to
    create signed apps.

    Anyway to run you need to set Security to Medium
    You do this with the Java ControlPanel
    which is normally in
 
     /usr/lib/jvm/<java version>/bin/ControlPanel 

    It is also advisable to have the Java Console enabled.
