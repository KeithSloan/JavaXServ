Install instructions for Raspbian
=================================

   sudo apt-get install libx11-dev libxpm-dev xvfb

   git clone git://git.code.sf.net/p/javaxserv/code javaxserv-code

   cd javaserv-code
   make

To Setup Demo 
=============

Webserver needs to be a static addresss as does machine where JavaXServ will run

Install X11 apps
    sudo apt-get install x11-apps

Copy www file to /var/www
    sudo cp -r  ~/javaxserv-code/www /var/www/
    cd ..

The two files config.php and configJar.php in www/Demo
need to be edited to reflect the IP address of the WebServer

Java Security needs Machine where JavaXServ runs to be the same as WenServer

To run JavaXServ
=================
    From directory javaserv-code/JavaXServ

    cd JavaXServ
    Xvfb :2 &
    export DISPLAY=:2.0
    ./javaXServ

From a Java Enabled Browser Access the Demo directory in www
=============================================================
     
    JavaXServ is an unsigned app.

    My understanding is that you have to pay money to get a certificate to
    create signed apps.

    Anyway to run you need to set Security to Medium
    You do this with the Java ControlPanel
    which is normally in
 
     /usr/lib/jvm/<java version>/bin/ControlPanel 

    It is also advisable to have the Java Console enabled.
